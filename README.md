# ðŸ‘‹ Meet ARA
ARA is a redundancy architecture for Java-level applications.
Originally build for [RustyConnector](https://github.com/Aelysium-Group/rustyconnector-core),
ARA decouples the connection between different modules allowing individual modules to be started, stopped, reloaded, etc without requiring the entire software to follow suit.
